              Click To Call allows customers to engage with support by requesting
              a phone call from a support agent. The information collected from the
              customer at the time of request allows the support agent to provide
              personalized and contextualized engagement.


            h4 User Requests A Call
            p.
              In this scenario, a user navigates to a form that requests a few key pieces of information including: their phone number, their reason for requesting a phone call, and a ticket number, if applicable. Behind the scenes, the form is also collecting their account number, account name, contact number, contact name, and what URL they were browing when they decided they needed to request a phone call. If there are any analytics tracking beacon IDs, those could also be included.

            p.
              The user enters in the necessary information, clicks 'Request A Call' and receives a notification of what number they should expect to receive a phone call from.

            h4 Orchestrate The Request
            p.
              The values for the requested call are used to populate the data for a new Task in a Twilio Workflow. The Task will follow the assigned Worklow until it reaches a TaskQueue where a Reservation for an available Worker is created. The Worker will receive a notification of the Reservation in their browser, and they choose to accept. This acceptance fires a series of callbacks which initiate a Conference bridge, dial the Worker, and connect the Worker to the Conference. Once the the Worker is connected, another callback is fired and the Customer is dialed and is connected to the Conference bridge.
